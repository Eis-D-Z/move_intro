# move_intro

## Part 1

Quick intro to Sui.

In this project we will aim to create a mini game on Sui that uses the famous SuiFrens (Capys).
The project will be split in many parts, during which Move concepts, hints and tricks will be explained.
Each part of this project will corespond to a tag and a branch, you will also be able to view the diff with the previous part.

## Part 2

The game will involve Capys and fighting thus we first need to create the weapons that are going to be used.
Key definition "Object" for Sui
How do we define an object in Move
How do we import in Move
Types - intro
Function declaration
Instantiating a struct
Return -> the way no one is using it

Key concept: Objects can only be accessed, mutated, instantiated or deleted in the module that defined them.


## Part 2.5
vector<u8> vs String how it shows on explorer

## Part 3

Explain why `return` is not needed.
Object deletion -- reiterate Key Concept on Object being accessible only in the module that defined it.
Vector explanation and nested vectors
References - intro

Consenquence of Key Concept --> need getters and setters every time.
